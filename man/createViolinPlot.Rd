\item{yName}{The name of the numeric variable (as a string) to plot on the y-axis.}

\item{fillName}{(Optional) The name of the variable (as a string) to use for fill colors. Default is NULL.}

\item{title}{The title of the plot. Default is "Distribution Plot".}

\item{colorMean}{The color to use for the mean symbol. Default is "blue".}

\item{colorMedian}{The color to use for the median symbol. Default is "green".}

\item{sizeMean}{The size of the mean symbol. Default is 3.}

}
\value{
A ggplot object representing the violin plot.
}
\description{
This function generates a violin plot enhanced with overlaid boxplots and
symbols for mean and median values. It uses ggplot2 for plotting, viridis for
color palettes, and hrbrthemes for themes.
