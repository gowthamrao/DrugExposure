\usage{
processTimeSeries(
  df,
  timeRepresentations = c("Day", "Week", "Month", "Quarter", "Year"),
  dateField = "cohortStartDate",
  weight = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the time series data.}

\item{timeRepresentations}{A character vector specifying the time units to aggregate by.
Accepted values are 'Day', 'Month', 'Quarter', 'Year'.
Default is c('Day', 'Month', 'Quarter', 'Year').}

\item{dateField}{The name of the column in \code{df} that contains the date information.
Defaults to 'cohortStartDate'.}

\item{weight}{An optional name of the column that contains weights for aggregation.
If NULL, each record is assumed to have an equal weight of 1.}
}
\value{
A list where each element corresponds to a specified time representation and
contains the processed data, the fitted model, its components, and a plot of the
decomposition.
}
\description{
This function performs STL decomposition on a data frame for specified time representations.
It requires a date field and can optionally use a weight field to aggregate data. The function
handles different time aggregations (e.g., Day, Month, Quarter, Year) and returns a list of
models, components, and plots for each time representation.
